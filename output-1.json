Questions\n\nGagan Dep Prabhu discussed the University lunch plan to determine why many students do not utilize the resource and addressed questions by the Senate:\n\nAre CPS students made aware of the CPS referendum?\n\nAnswer: Yes. We are working closely with CPS and ensuring the goals of the referendum are constantly being reached out to all CPS students through emails from their college administration. We will also be organizing town halls over the next month to interact with students.\n\nWhen will CPS officially be included if the referendum passes?\n\nAnswer: Depends on CPS. We are looking to include them by Fall 2020, officially.\n\nWhy do we need to run a referendum?\n\nAnswer: CPS students don’t pay a student activity fee. Moving forward, if they are to be officially recognized by the GSG, they will be required to pay the fee. That would make a change at the college-level and a referendum needs to pass with majority votes of yes for it to be implemented.\n\nWhy don’t students prefer the lunch plan provided by the University?\n\nAnswer: Senate – The plan is too expensive.\n\nDoes mode of transportation matter to apply for travel funding?\n\nAnswer: To some extent, yes. You will have to communicate with the Vice President of Financial Affairs (Robert Hass) regarding that.\n\n \n\n4.

Regional Campus – Divya Subbaian, Vice-President of Marketing and Outreach\n\nGSG in Regional Campuses – The values of ‘One’ Northeastern, diverse network, academic excellence, global university, inclusive community, and experiential learning resonate through its 7 regional campuses. Starting with Seattle and San Francisco, GSG proposes to expand its network in three different phases to further reinforce these values\nPhase 1: Pilot, where GSG, Boston would be introduced to regional campus students and involve them as affiliated members. This would help build a graduate network and a community for further interactions across all Northeastern campuses\nPhase 2: Assess the result of phase 1 and continue to involve regional campus with GSG, Boston or launch independent GSGs if required. Also, initiate a permanent model\nPhase 3: Focus on growth within regional campuses\nBenefits: Facilitate students’ experiences beyond academics and their representation in decision making. It would also directly align with the ‘Northeastern 2025’ goal to initiate a diverse graduate and alumni network at the University.\nSenators will be recruited to work in a Regional Campus committee.

Questions\n\nGagan Dep Prabhu addressed questions by the Senate:\n\nWhen will funding and Student Activity fee collection for CPS students commence?\n\nAnswer: The funding for activities (other than for conferences) by GSG with Student Finance Office will commence from spring 2020, but the student activity fee collection will only begin from Summer 2, i.e. July 2020. Funding for conferences will also commence from Summer 2.\n\nHow to form a student group?\n\nAnswer: The first step is to talk with the GSG Executive Board and to check if there are any similar groups. Deependra Singh, Vice President of Student Affairs will take the team through the steps and will work with the Center for Student Involvement (CSI) to form the constitution. The group would attain tentative recognition for a period of 4 months and then attain permanent recognition.\n\nLuke, representing Civil & Environmental Engineering Graduate Student Council (CEE GSC) addressed the following questions by the Senate:\n\nHow do you reach out to students?\n\nAnswer: Through email, WhatsApp and WeChat.\n\nAre there any resource for students who are interested in research?\n\nAnswer: Discussions are underway with the department to set up a formal committee to help students interested in research.\n\n \n\n5.

The GSG had originally decided to offer conference funding to graduate students in an effort to supplement already existing sources of funding that students may have had access to from their supervisors, departments, or colleges. However, with time the demand on us grew so much that in the budget year 2014-2015 2/3rds ($100,000) of our budget was going towards funding conference attendance. This had proven to become a huge budgetary constraint for us because no matter what we did we could never meet the overwhelming demand for conference attendance funding with our meager funds. Moreover, the job of accepting, and processing conference attendance applications was proving to be onerous. We could not effectively make a value judgment on the nature of the conference and/or the quality of work of the attendee and so we were operating on a first come first serve model almost exclusively.\n\nAt our first meeting with the (then) new Provost James Bean we brought up our budgetary and personnel constraints. Provost Bean agreed that the GSG is not the most suitable nor the most effective home for centralized conference funding.\n\nSo, last year (which also happened to be our 20th anniversary!) we decided to ask you what you wanted in our annual survey. Overwhelmingly graduate students told us that they would prefer that the student fee did not go to conference funding and that they wanted to see more on campus programming from us. We had already stepped up our on campus programming last year and the great attendance was the final push that we needed. The GSG senate took your needs to heart and agreed to cut $40,000 from the individual conference attendance line item of the GSG budget.\n\nWe also presented our survey results to the university’s senior leadership team (SLT) in January – the reception was great. At our follow up meeting in March with the SLT the university committed to make up the $40k shortfall in the conference attendance line item in the GSG budget. Also, we have been promised an online application system which would take away much of the processing from the GSG.\n\nWhile we switch to a centralized online application model, the GSG will still be accepting and processing conference funding applications. However in an effort to make the application and approval process more fair we have agreed to a priority model of approvals. The priority goes as follows:\n\nPanelist/Presenter (PhD)\nPoster (PhD)\nPanelist/Presenter (non PhD)\nPoster (non PhD)\nGeneral attendee\n\nPlease note that approvals and awards are never guaranteed. The approval and amount of the award can differ depending on the availability of funds.\n\nPlease bear with us as we go through the changes of the conference application and awarding process as we work with the Provost’s office to make the process more efficient and equitable.\n\nIf you have concerns or questions about this please do not hesitate to email us at GSG2@neu.edu.\n\nCheers,\n\nGraduate Student Government\n\nNov 13, 2018\nLeave A Comment\nOn Conference Funding Changes\nUpdates\nAbout the Author\nGraduate Student Government\nPost navigation\nMeeting Minutes – January 30, 2018\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Guest Speakers from University Health and Counseling Services\n\nKelly A. Moran, LMHC, director of Coordinated Care and Health Promotion, and Renee Smith, Student Health Plan Manager, of the University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS) spoke about the services offered and resources available to students.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the office is serving the university community through Telehealth. No walk-in appointments are available at this time. Below are highlights of the presentation:\n\nThe University Health Report must be submitted by the graduate students one month before entering the university, Proof of Immunity is required by the Massachusetts state law. The governor of Massachusetts included a new mandate in August 2020 which requires every student under the age of 30 who attend even one day of class in person, need to show proof that they have received the Influenza immunization (flu vaccine) by December 31st, 2020.\n\nUHCS offers medical services, including assessment for routine concerns; urgent care; women’s health, sports medicine, nutrition visits; and referrals to ongoing community and specialist care.\n\nWell Connection – Is a program for students enrolled in the Northeastern University Student Health Plan (NUSHP). In the plan, students have access to the Telehealth services. The services allow for immediate consultation with a medical clinician on video(Zoom) for both physical and mental concerns for a $10 co-pay per visit.\n\nMental Health Support – Offers scheduled phone consultations with mental health clinicians who conduct a brief assessment and make recommendations for care. These recommendations might include a referral for ongoing therapy or psychopharmacology with a clinician off campus and/or follow up with a clinician at UHCS. Additional services are Find@Northeastern; medication assessment; student support groups; and sexual assault response and treatment.\n\nMental Health Services: Support Groups – Several support groups are offered each semester. Groups are confidential, safe, and nonjudgmental spaces where a student can offer and receive support from your peers, learn new skills, find connections, and explore ways of coping. Anyone interested in joining a group can contact UHCS at the contact information below.\n\nFind @Northeastern – provides “Support when you need it, anytime, anywhere” for full-time degree seeking students. The program offers support and resources that helps one find oneself, can give one a peace of mind, and can provide one’s distinctive path; designed to offer students an immediate touchpoint for help and resources at anytime from anywhere.\n\nKey Benefits are, expands immediate mental health clinician access to 24/7; makes Northeastern mental health response available to our students locally, nationally, and internationally; serves as an additional access point for students who may hesitate to reach out for in-person mental healthcare; enhances referral options, process, and capacity; and removes a cost barrier for Telehealth and face-to-face therapy.\n\n24/7 Support Line – Provides support anytime and anywhere; the staff is master’s level, licensed mental health counselors; immediate safety and risk assessment and coordination with emergency protocols as appropriate; and non-emergent connection to next steps, resources, and treatment options.\n\nUHCS and Find@Northeastern services are confidential. The office is connected with the NU Police Department (NUPD) regarding safety concerns. “When in doubt or concerned about a student – talk it out!” (and follow up with your supervisor and make them aware of the issue).\n\nNUPD, UHCS and We Care are working together to provide services and connect students to resources. We Care focuses on intense issues and if a learner is considered “at risk” or is of concern, the student should be on We Care’s radar. Anyone of these organizations can direct students to the correct services for them.\n\nNortheastern University Student Health Plan (NUSHP)\n\nCoverage – Available anywhere; comprehensive healthcare coverage at school, at home, while traveling, on co-op or study abroad\nSavings – Affordable coverage, low co-payments, caps on annual out-of-pocket costs, and access to reduced dental, vision and pharmacy\nGlobal protection – 24/7 emergency medical care and assistance anywhere in the world.\n\nSteps to accessing NUSHP membership ID # are available on MyNortheastern account.

CDC recommends getting it by October before the flu season begins but the state requires you to get it by 31st December.

Resume Writing – Elizaveta Butsenevskaya (NU Alumni, Product Designer)\n\nElizaveta, an international student with experience gives a brief background about herself and about her passion project which is to help international students understand the whole job search process and challenges that they face.\n\nShe talks about how to pass the ATS scan and get your Resume to be read by a recruiter. The key takeaways are:\n\ni) 75% job applications are rejected before they are read by a human due to the usage of applications tracking systems by companies to streamline the hiring process.\n\nii) Tweaking the job role based on the job description gets extra points by the ATS system.\n\niii) The technical terminology for the hard skills should be an exact match with those required in the job description.\n\nIv) ATS would be unable to scan through fancy resumes with creative edits and hence would not pass the resume to the recruiter.\n\nv) Creative resumes can be used when the resume is directly being sent to the recruiter or being printed out at the time of the job interview.\n\nvi) ATS works better with the Word format as compared to PDF. \n\n4. Upcoming Events and Feedback/Polls:\n\nDivya Subbaian abd Gagan Prabhu gives an update about the upcoming Events for the following weeks which are the i) GSG Merchandise Giveaway ii) Virtual Escape Room iii) Movie Night.

Environmental Justice Climate Equity\n\nYasmina Estepe and Aubrey Thomas talk about the NU CAP which is a student led organization which focuses on creating the climate action plan for a sustainable environment with a focus on inclusion, diversity and equity. They brainstormed ideas along with students on possible ways to have a greater outreach and student engagement.

Part of your student activities fee goes directly to a fund controlled and dispersed by GSG. Its purpose is to provide funding for both graduate student groups as well as individual students traveling to conferences, competitions, and other academic activities. All Northeastern graduate students are invited to apply.\n\n \nHow does this work?\n\nIndividual Funding: Attending a conference? Graduate students currently in good standing are eligible for up to $375 per academic year for reimbursement of conference expenses.\n\nStudent Group Funding: Sponsoring an event? Graduate student groups recognized by the Campus Activities and Program Office are eligible for funding to support events that enhance the graduate student experience. Funds are transferred to the student group’s SABO account after GSG approval. Funding applications must be submitted at least 4 weeks in advance of when you need access to the funds. For events requiring contracts, ticketing, or other components that require lengthy planning timelines, please submit your funding application at least 2-3 months prior to your event. Groups can receive up to $5,000 each academic year. For more information, please read the Student Group funding regulations.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Bosa. Powered by Bosa Themes"

Applications are closed and would open in August 2022. Applications open up twice every year: July-August and December-January.\n\nLink: https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/csi/starting-an-organization-2/\n\nLog in using your Northeastern account and search for ‘New Student Organization Proposal Form’\n\nPlease note: Locate a full-time member of the University staff or faculty to serve as your advisor. If you need help with this, touch base with the CSI office.\n\nStep 2: Preliminary Recognition\n\nCSI would review your application and your group would receive preliminary recognition. CSI would request additional information in the form of supporting documentation.\n\nNote: Preliminary recognition does not entitle you to any privilege available to a recognized group.\n\nStep 3: Constitution\n\nThis is where your group would work with the Student Affairs committee on their constitution. You could think of ‘constitution’ as a set of guidelines that your group if recognized, would have to strictly abide by.\n\nThe Vice President of Student Affairs or a representative from the Student Affairs Committee would assist you with a sample constitution. However, please note with the new process, failing to put in efforts while drafting the constitution would be grounds for rejection of the application. Once your constitution is approved by the GSG, your group receives Tentative recognition.\n\nStep 4: Trial period\n\nYour group would then be monitored over the next couple of months to evaluate if you meet certain expectations. SABO would process temporary financial accounts. You would have access to limited funds during this period.\n\nStep 5: Presentation\n\nYour group would need to present in one of the senate meetings followed by a vote by all the active senators. GSG would recommend your group for permanent recognition if you obtain the majority vote from the senate.\n\nStep 6: Official Recognition\n\nCSI would then submit an official recognition letter to your group. You would now have access to all the privileges of an officially recognized graduate group.\n\nFor any and all other information, please reach out to Graduate Student Government VP for Student Affairs GSGStudentAffairs@northeastern.edu.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Bosa.
